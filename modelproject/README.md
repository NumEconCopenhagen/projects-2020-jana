# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Ramsey model** and is about defining the model and finding the steady state level of capital and consumption.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

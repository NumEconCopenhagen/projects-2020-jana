# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Ramsey model** and is about finding the steady-state level of capital and consumption. Firstly, we describe the model. Secondly, we find the solution for steady-state both analytically and numerically and we construct a phase diagram to visualize the results. Lastly, we assume further analysis. We consider the change preference parameter and we introduce government expenditure. Both cases are visualized by interactive phase diagrams.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
